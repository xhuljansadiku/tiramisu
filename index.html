        <b>Tiramisu</b> is a timeless no-bake Italian dessert combining espresso-dipped ladyfingers and a creamy lightly sweetened mascarpone cream. 
        <br>
         This recipe is from the late Maida Heatter and is easily the best homemade tiramisu recipe that I’ve ever tried.</p>

        <p>A couple months ago, I was sent a new cookbook called Happiness is Baking. This cookbook includes Maida Heatter’s favorite recipes with
            <br>
            the foreword written by Dorie Greenspan. I, unsurprisingly, immediately fell in love with my newest cookbook. It’s a collection of 100 
         <br>
         foolproof and classic desserts including cookies, cakes, muffins, pies, tarts, and more that range from simple everyday cookies to 
         <br>
         outrageously indulgent chocolate soufflé cake.</p>

         <h3>Ingredients</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>1 and 1/4 cups (300ml) very strongly prepared espresso, warm or room temperature</li>
            <li>6 Tablespoons (90ml) Grand Marnier*</li>
            <li>40–45 ladyfingers*</li>
            <li>16 ounces (about 2 cups; 450g) mascarpone, cold or at room temperature</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (60ml) dark rum</li>
            <li>4 large pasteurized eggs, separated*</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar, divided*</li>
            <li>2 cups (480ml) heavy cream or heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>unsweetened natural or dutch-process cocoa powder</li>
         </ul>
         
         <br>

         <p>For those not familiar, Maida Heatter is an icon, especially in the baking world. Dubbed the Queen of Cake, her expansive culinary career
            <br>
             included 9 cookbooks, recipes for the Times, a restaurant, and three James Beard Awards. Baker and author Dorie Greenspan once said
             <br>
              “Whenever someone tells me they want to learn to bake, I tell them to start with Maida Heatter’s books. That’s what I did.” This latest 
              <br>
               cookbook is a testament to Maida’s legacy. She passed away only 2 months after this book was published. She leaves behind an incalculable 
               <br>
                amount of inspiration to bakers and cooks all over the world.</p>

                <h2>Common Tiramisu Questions – Answered</h2>
                <dl>
                    <dt><b>What kind of rum do I use in tiramisu?</b></dt>
                    <dd>Dark rum is best, but you can use brandy or your favorite coffee liqueur.</dd>
                    <dt><b>Egg whites or whipped cream?</b></dt>
                    <dd>Most tiramisu recipes use whipped egg whites OR whipped cream in the mascarpone cream layers. Egg whites contribute a more airy 
                        <br>
                         texture, while whipped cream makes the filling a bit more rich. This recipe actually uses both, so you’re getting both delightful 
                         <br>
                          textures.</dd>

                          <dt><b>Are the eggs cooked?</b></dt>
                          <dd>Tiramisu is a no-bake dessert. The egg yolks are gently cooked on the stovetop, but the egg whites are raw. Purchase pasteurized eggs
                            <br>
                             because they are safe to consume raw.</dd>

                             <dt><b>What size pan to use?</b></dt>
                             <dd>This particular tiramisu recipe yields a large volume and the pan will be very full. Make sure your pan is large enough. I recommend a 
                                <br>
                                 9×13 inch dish with at least a 12-14 cup capacity. This 4 quart dish is wonderful too.</dd>
